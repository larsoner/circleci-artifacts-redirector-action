# circleci-artifacts-redirector

GitHub Action to add a GitHub status link to a CircleCI artifact.

## Example usage

Sample `.github/workflows/main.yml`:

```YAML
on: [status]
jobs:
  circleci_artifacts_redirector_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Run CircleCI artifacts redirector
    steps:
      - name: GitHub Action step
        uses: larsoner/circleci-artifacts-redirector-action@master
        with:
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          artifact-path: 0/test_artifacts/root_artifact.md
          circleci-jobs: build_doc
```

- The `artifact-path` should point to an artifact path from your CircleCI
  build. This is typically whatever follows the CircleCI artifact root path,
  for example `0/test_artifacts/root_artifact.md`.
- The `circleci-jobs` is a comma-separated list of jobs to monitor, but usually
  there is a single one that you want an artifact path for.
  The default is `"build_docs,build,doc"`, which will look for any
  jobs with these names and create an artifacts link for them.
- If you have trouble, try [enabling debugging logging](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/managing-a-workflow-run#enabling-debug-logging)
  for the action.

> **Note**: The standard PR-to-main-repo-from-branch-in-a-fork workflow might
> not activate the action. For changes to take effect, changes might need to be
> made to to the default branch *in a repo with the action enabled*. For
> example, you could iterate directly in `master`, or in `master` of a fork.
> This seems to be a limitation of the fact that CircleCI uses the `status`
> (rather than app) API and that this is always tied to the `master`/default
> branch of a given repository.

## Limitations

Currently has (known) limitations:

- Tests do not test anything (haven't gotten around to fixing them)
- Only allows redirecting to a single file that must be configured ahead of
  time as a file (cannot be changed within the CircleCI run)

Eventually this might be fixable by a bit of work and addition of
customization options.
